A dashboard displaying shopping carts. The list, and details of each one of them including a price chart.

Data is fetched from external API. As POST and DELETE methods are not affecting the server side, adding and removing carts is handled via browsers local storage. The requests are there working, though.

Stack and features: React router | API | dynamic charts
