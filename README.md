A dashboard displaying shopping carts. The list, and details of each one of them, including a price chart.

Data is fetched from an external API. As POST and DELETE methods are not affecting the server side, adding and removing carts is handled via the browser’s local storage. The requests are there working, though - ‘OK’ responses trigger front-end actions.
